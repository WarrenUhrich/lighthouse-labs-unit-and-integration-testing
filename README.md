## Types of Testing

### What Types of Testing Have We Used So Far?

* Manual Testing (write code and see if it works! Try a `console.log`)
  * Visual Testing: Have a look to see if the output (esp. in the case of a web page) looks as-expected!
* Unit Testing: Testing a small piece of code (function, component.)
* Static Testing: Give us real-time guidance in following syntax and best-practice in our code editor (ESLint.)

Test-Driven Development: Aiming to write tests first, and then program features.

### Other Type of Testing

* Integration Testing: Testing multiple units (functions or components) working together.

## Testing Tools

* Mocha: Testing framework and test-runner. (Helps with testing functions, callbacks, promises - all kinds of JS-related code.)
* Chai: Assertion library!
  * NodeJS `assert` only came with a dozen or so possible assertions...
  * Chai opened the door to having 100 different possible assertions!
* Jest: Testing framework intended/optimized for React! Created by Meta/Facebook.

Mocha and Chai can be used for Unit and Integration Testing.
Jest can be used for Unit and Integration Testing.
